### chemilang and crnsimul
First of all, [crnsimul](https://github.com/RasmusRendal/crnsimul) is a C++ application that simulates chemical reaction networks.
In turn, [chemilang](https://github.com/RasmusRendal/chemilang) is a compiler which compiles from our language, chemilang, into chemical reaction networks. These should make it easier to write cool CRN applications.

CRNs as a subject is extremely interesting, and everyone should know more about it.
