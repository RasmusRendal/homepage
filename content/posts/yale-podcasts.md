The Open Yale Courses are pretty amazing.
I enjoy listening to them while doing dishes and stuff like that.
For ease of listening, I converted them to podcast feeds.
It's a bit of a hack. I didn't set the length and filesize of the files properly, so it'll look weird in your client until you download them.
But that's good enough for me.

For an overview of the courses, see the page on the [Yale Website](https://oyc.yale.edu/courses). I can personally recommend Don Quixote and Introduction to the Old Testament.
