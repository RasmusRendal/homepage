### chemilang and crnsimul
First of all, [crnsimul](https://github.com/RasmusRendal/crnsimul) is a C++ application that simulates chemical reaction networks.
In turn, [chemilang](https://github.com/RasmusRendal/chemilang) is a compiler which compiles from our language, chemilang, into chemical reaction networks. These should make it easier to write cool CRN applications.

CRNs as a subject is extremely interesting, and everyone should know more about it.

### Fricloud
Me and a couple of friends share a VPS, on which we selfhost a bunch of services. Ideally, we would like to expand this into something other people who care about their privacy can join, even if they don't have any sysadmin skills to speak of. Sort of like a cyber-coop.
